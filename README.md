# Solidity Type Conversion Utils

## Motivation
Conversion between types in Solidity can be tricky. Sometimes explicit typecasting would do the work, while it won't in other occasions (e.g. `addressToString`, i.e. hexstring to UTF-8).

If you are looking for utility library for bytes and string operations,
look no further than [Goncalo's bytes-utils](https://github.com/GNSPS/solidity-bytes-utils) and [Nick Johnson's stringutils](https://github.com/Arachnid/solidity-stringutils).

This library is mainly for **conversion between types**, especially between `uint`, `bytes` and `string`, fixed or dyanmic, we would like to abstract away those details and provide clean, intuitive API for Solidity dev.
